## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does it take to find a nursing home?

Ideally, start researching 2-3 months before needed. In urgent situations (post-hospitalization), it can be done in 1-2 weeks but choices may be limited.

Yes, you can transfer to another facility. Review the contract for notice periods (usually 2-4 weeks). Document any issues before leaving.

### How often should family visit?

There's no set rule, but regular visits (weekly if possible) help maintain connection and allow you to monitor care quality. Even short visits matter.

### What if my loved one refuses to go?

This is common. Try to understand their fears, involve them in the decision, arrange visits before moving, and consider a trial period. A good facility can often help with the transition.

### How do I know if my loved one is receiving good care?

Regular visits at different times, open communication with staff, observing physical and emotional wellbeing, and talking to other families can help you assess care quality.
