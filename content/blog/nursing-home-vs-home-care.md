## Factors to Consider

### 1. Care Needs Assessment

**Questions to ask:**
- How much help is needed with bathing, dressing, toileting?
- Is medication management complex?
- Are there wandering or safety concerns?
- Is there a medical condition requiring monitoring?
- Can they be left alone for any period?

**Rule of thumb:**
- Mild needs - Home care may work
- Moderate needs - Either option
- Complex/medical needs - Nursing home often better

### 2. Cost Comparison

For equivalent levels of care:

| Scenario | Nursing Home | Home Care |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| Basic supervision | RM2,500/month | RM3,500/month (live-in) |
| 24/7 skilled care | RM6,000/month | RM10,000+/month (shift nurses) |
| Memory care | RM7,000/month | RM12,000+/month (specialized) |

**Key insight:** 24/7 home care is often MORE expensive than a nursing home because you need multiple caregivers for round-the-clock coverage.

### 3. Family Situation

- Family caregivers are exhausted

**Choose home care if:**

### 4. Home Environment

**Is your home suitable?**
- Can a wheelchair navigate the space?
- Is the bathroom accessible?
- Are there stairs that pose risks?
- Is there room for a hospital bed if needed?
- Can modifications be made?

### 5. Elderly Person's Preference

If possible, involve your loved one in the decision:
- Do they want to stay home?
- Are they open to moving to a community?
- What matters most to them?
