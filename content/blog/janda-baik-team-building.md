### HRDF-Claimable Options

Several Janda Baik venues partner with HRDF-registered training providers. If your company wants to claim team building costs:

1. Confirm the programme includes structured learning outcomes
2. Ensure facilitators are HRDF-certified
3. Request documentation for claims submission
4. Book through an approved training provider

Not all team building programmes qualify — pure recreation typically doesn't meet HRDF requirements.

**High ropes and obstacle courses:** Several venues have purpose-built challenge courses testing trust, communication, and teamwork.

**Flying fox / zip lines:** Available at select venues for adrenaline-pumping team experiences.

## Planning Your Janda Baik Team Building

### Best Time to Visit

**Ideal:** March-September (drier months)

**Avoid:** November-January (monsoon season, flash flood risk)

**Weekdays:** Better availability and sometimes lower prices

**Weekends:** Book 4-6 weeks ahead during peak periods

### Group Size Considerations

**Small teams (10-20):** Most venues accommodate easily. Consider exclusive bookings for privacy.

**Medium teams (20-50):** Good options available. Book early for preferred venues.

**Large teams (50-100+):** Limited venue choices. Cherengin Hills and a few others can handle larger groups.

**Very large (100+):** May need to split across multiple venues or consider alternative destinations.

### Getting There

**By car:** Take the Karak Highway, exit at Bentong, follow signs to Janda Baik. 45-60 minutes from KL.

**By bus:** No direct public transport. Arrange private coach or van.

**Tip:** Coordinate carpooling or arrange company transport. Some venues offer shuttle services from pickup points.

### What to Pack

- Comfortable clothes for outdoor activities
- Covered shoes for jungle activities
- Swimwear and towel for water activities
- Light jacket (evenings are cool)
- Insect repellent
- Personal medications
- Camera for team photos
